# Smart Agriculture System using IoT and Machine Learning

This project implements a Smart Agriculture System that uses IoT sensors and Machine Learning models to intelligently predict whether irrigation is needed, based on real-time environmental data like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and motion detection. The system aims to optimize water usage and promote sustainable farming practices.

# Key Features

  Real-time data collection using IoT sensors

  Predicts irrigation needs using ML models

  Compares performance of multiple classifiers

  Visualizations: confusion matrix, decision tree, feature importance
